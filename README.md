This cross-walk provides CCNs for IPPS hospitals receiving  relief funding from the 2020 CARES Act and subsequent legislation.  Please note that in some instances, a single entity received payment under multiple names (or spellings).  In other instances, a single payment was disbursed to cover multiple hospitals (e.g., New York City public hospitals, which received payments both together and separately)
